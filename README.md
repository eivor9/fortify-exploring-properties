# fortify-exploring-properties


This calculator was built with html, css and javascript. Most of the code was taken from the Youtube video by GreatStack on how to build a calculator app. * As inspiration for colors and buttons i followed the design language of Apple's recent iPhone calculator app they've been using for the last few years. Also added a background to match the desktop wallpaper of macOS Catalina 's dark mode
